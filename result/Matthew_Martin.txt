Hey Matthew!

I hope you're doing great! I'm excited to invite you to join our Skool community, and I think you'll find it to be an invaluable resource as a frontend developer.

Every Tuesday at 6 PM Eastern Time, we host coaching calls where you can connect with like-minded individuals and get support for your projects. We're close to reaching a milestone of 500 users, and it's a fantastic platform for discussing and learning about best practices for frontend optimization – something you mentioned being interested in during our last conversation.

Our community is a warm, welcoming place where you can ask questions, share your knowledge, and get assistance from fellow developers. Plus, it's completely free to join!

I'm confident you'll find immense value in being part of our community, and I hope to see you at our next coaching call. If you have any questions or need more information, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here to help!

Best,
Shivam Chhetry
