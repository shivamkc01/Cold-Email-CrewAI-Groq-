Hey Alice,

I hope you're doing great!

I'm thrilled to invite you to join our Skool community. We host lively coaching calls every Tuesday at 6 PM Eastern Time, and we'd be thrilled if you could join us!

Our community is your go-to resource for all things related to your projects and connecting with like-minded individuals. It's completely free, and we're just about to hit a significant milestone of 500 users.

As a frontend developer with a knack for user experience design, you'll bring invaluable insights to our community. We're excited to see how you'll collaborate with others and help one another.

Looking forward to seeing you at our next coaching call! If you have any questions or need more information, just let me know. I'm here to help!

Best,
Shivam Chhetry
