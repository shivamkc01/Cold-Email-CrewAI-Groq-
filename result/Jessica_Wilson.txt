Hey Jessica Wilson!

I'm so glad to reach out to you today! I hope you're having a fantastic day.

I'm thrilled to invite you to join our Skool community! Our weekly coaching calls are every Tuesday at 6 PM Eastern Time, and we'd be thrilled to have you join us!

The best part? It's completely free! We're about to hit a milestone of 500 users, and the energy is electric.

Our community is an amazing resource for support with your projects, connecting with like-minded individuals, and getting answers to your questions. Need help or assistance? Our members and coaching calls are here for you.

I loved our recent conversation about integrating a new microservice into the existing system and am confident you'll find the discussions in our community incredibly valuable.

We can't wait to welcome you to our community and see you at our next coaching call! If you have any questions or need further information, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here for you!

All the best,
Shivam Chhetry
