Hey Michael!

I hope you're doing well. I'm excited to invite you to join our Skool community—it's completely free, and we'd love for you to be a part of it!

We host weekly coaching calls every Tuesday at 6 PM Eastern Time, and I think you'll find our community to be a fantastic resource. As a full-stack developer specializing in JavaScript frameworks, your expertise and insights would be a valuable addition to our group.

We're about to reach a milestone of 500 users, and our community is a great place to stay updated on new features and their impact on existing functionality. Need help with a project or want to connect with others who share your interests? Our members and coaching calls are here for you!

We recently discussed new features and their impact, and I believe our community will be an excellent platform for you to share your insights with others.

Excited to welcome you to our community and see you at our next coaching call! If you have any questions or need further information, don't hesitate to reach out.

Best,
Shivam Chhetry
